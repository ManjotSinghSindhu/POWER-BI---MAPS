# POWER-BI---MAPS

Maps are a representation of the location of any place which uses coordinates or also known as latitudes and longitudes to display a place on a map, in power bi it is integrated with bing maps, bing being a search engine just like google to help a user in the creation of maps.

The map is a kind of vision as part of Power BI visualization software. Using this visual, we can show geographic-based or location data values on respective areas of the map according to the location name. You must be wondering how this Map visually identifies the location on the map.

The thing is Power BI maps are integrated with “Bing Maps” so that it coordinates with location names from the data. So, using Bing Map, we can create two kinds of Maps visuals in Power BI, one is a Bubble Map, and another one is Filled Maps. What Bing does is recognizes the location name, address, or any geographical attribute and plot the selected data on the map.

**Things to Remember**

1. Map visual requires the exact location name to identify the location on the map.

2. Size should always be the numerical data set to show the bubble size.

3. You can increase, decrease the size of the bubble and change the colors of each bubble to a different color.
